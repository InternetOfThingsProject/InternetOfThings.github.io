    Christopher's tend to by shy individuals, but don't be fooled:
    when a Christopher emerges from his shell, it is like seeing the 
    brightest heart-warming rays of sunshine, on a rainy, cloud-besmirched 
    day. His shyness acts as an obstacle in getting to know him, but don't 
    give up. Once you know him, you'll discover that he's one of the most 
    thoughtful, witty, intelligent people that you will ever encounter. 
    Sometimes, when you're nattering away, to him, it may seem like he's 
    not listening, but truth be told, he's always listening. Arguments and
    debates are his strong points (you can almost, never win.) He makes 
    you smile, and laugh inadvertently- you don't even realise you're 
    smiling, until he points it out with a magical, charming chuckle, 
    in his voice. You feel like you could easily spend the rest of your 
    life, in blissful contentment with him, even through the arguments, 
    and the fights. In a nutshell, he's everything you've been looking for.
    Girl: I wish my guy could be more like Christopher.
